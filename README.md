# Kotlin Design Patterns Repository
Overview
This repository provides Kotlin implementations of 10 popular design patterns, spanning creational, structural, and behavioral categories. The goal is to offer clear code examples and concise documentation that help you understand, learn, and apply these patterns in real-world projects.

Organization
The repository is structured into folders based on pattern categories:

Creational Patterns:
Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, and Builder.

Structural Patterns:
Examples include Adapter, Decorator, and Facade.

Behavioral Patterns:
Examples include Observer, Strategy, and Command.

Each design pattern is implemented in its own file (or files, when necessary) with in-line comments explaining its purpose and usage. Additional documentation within each folder provides detailed descriptions and example scenarios.

Table of Contents
Singleton
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Factory Method
Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

Abstract Factory
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Builder
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

Adapter
Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface that clients expect.

Decorator
Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, offering a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

Observer
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Strategy
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

Command
Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests and the queuing or logging of requests.

Facade
Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to interact with.
