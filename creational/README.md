# Creational Desing Patterns
## Singelton

One of the most common, controversial yet the most straightforward creational desing pattern. The main idea of Singleton is to create a single object that is shared amongst a bunch of different resources throughout your application without recreating that particular object. All the variables, methods, states, etc. are shared between these resources (objects) that are using it and there is just one source of information for this object, one source of truth. Only a single type (one instance) of this object is created at any given time.

There is a theory that Singleton is an anti-pattern, and there are many reasons for this. First and foremost, Singleton is global to your entire application, like a global variable that can be changed from any where in the program. So when debugging, it can be challenging to figure out which code path leads to the Singleton's current state. Lastly, you can run into a race condition where changing things inside of a Singleton in different parts of your application at the same time can cause data to get overwritten or not read correctly because they are trying to access the same information at the same time. (using the key word object in Kotlin we can make initialization  of our object thread-safe without any additional steps, but we still need to make sure that our methods are safe)
